<!-- 

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, 
using newline characters to separate lines. 
At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character. 
The characters should form a chess board.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable size = 8 and 
change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width 
and height. (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
