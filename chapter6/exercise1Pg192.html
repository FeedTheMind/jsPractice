    <p>What problem does the following code solve?</p>
    <p>
      <code>
        <var>var</var> myString = 'This sentence has has a fault, and and we need to fix it.';<br>
        <var>var</var> myRegExp = /(\b\w+\b) \1/g;<br>
        myString = myString.replace(myRegExp, '$1');<br>
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      The above code matches and replaces the repeated words, "has has" and "and and."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, imagine that you have the following:<br>
      <code>
        var myRegExp = new RegExp('(\b\w+\b) \1');<br>
      </code>
      <br>Why would this not work, and how could you fix it?<br>
      <br>This would not work because a constructor object has been created with a string parameter. To fix this, add two backslashes, not one, before special characters.<br>Moreover, the global match ('g' modifier) should be passed to the second parameter, that the program does not stop after the first matched result.
